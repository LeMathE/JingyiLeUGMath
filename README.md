Hi, here's Jingyi Le, to update and store my thoughts and progress in mathematics. last version: Dec 2024
This is where I store the math projects/thoughts I did as an undergraduate which may includes
- notes for mathematics modules I took (KCL teaching UG22-25, BICMR, Part III,...)
- my research work in NumberTheory and Dynamics (Warwick, Cambridge)
- code generated to some competitions
- ...
- 
I hope these documents can not only help me have a clearer understanding of the problems I'm dealing with (every step you take counts), but also bring some inspiration for someone or myself.
